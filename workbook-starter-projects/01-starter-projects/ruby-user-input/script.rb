# Developer: Captain DevOps, this Ruby script prompts the user for their name and then greets them.
#            To run this script, you would typically use the command:
#            ruby script.rb
#            Replace 'script.rb' with the actual script name.
#            I trust you'll navigate the execution of this script within a Docker container with ease!
